## By now you are probably wondering, who *is* this man? Like, "buddy, get on with it! WE NEED TO KNOW YOUR NAME!"

First of all, lower your tone. My name is Nick Stevenson. Nice to meet you! I am a current master's student at the University of Texas at San Antonio studying data analytics. While I am now in my third semester of grad school, I am still relatively new to the field of data science. Currently I work for the United States Postal Service. In the market for some stamps? I may know a guy...
